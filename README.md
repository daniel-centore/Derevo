# Derevo
Derevo is a Git GUI for working with Stacked Pull Requests

# Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/daniel-centore/Derevo.git
cd Derevo
npm install

# If the above line gives a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'"
# error, run one of the following to install setuptools:
# > brew install python-setuptools
# > pip install setuptools
# > pip3 install setuptools

npm run start
```

Strongly recommended you pull periodically as this is still very under development!
